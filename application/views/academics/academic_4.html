		      <p>报告主题：Asymptotically Efficient Algorithms for Skyline Probabilities of Uncertain Data</p>
		      <p>报告人：袁豪（2002级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：Skyline computation is widely used in multi-criteria decision making. As research in uncertain databases draws increasing attention, skyline queries with uncertain data have also been studied. While some earlier work focused on probabilistic skylines with a given threshold, Atallah and Qi [Atallah and Qi 2009] studied the problem to compute skyline probabilities for all instances of uncertain objects without the use of thresholds, and proposed an algorithm with sub-quadratic time complexity. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for computing all skyline probabilities that is asymptotically faster.

		      <p>报告主题：EPF: An Event-aided Packet Forwarding Protocol for Privacy-preserving Mobile Healthcare Social Networks</p>
		      <p>报告人：陈乐（2003级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：In this paper, we propose an event-aided packet forwarding (EPF) protocol, which enables patients to efficiently communicate with each other in privacy-preserving Mobile Healthcare Social Networks (MHSNs). Since patients with common illnesses often attend the same related activities, EPF makes use of these activities in forwarding illness-related messages to the target patients so that it can achieve high target patients coverage ratio. In addition, EPF also adopts predicate encryption to guarantee patient privacy and message confidentiality. Through security analysis, we demonstrate that EPF can effectively resist various attacks launched by adversaries, and ensure patient identity and illness privacy. Extensive simulations are also conducted to evaluate the performance of EPF in terms of average target patients coverage ratio, average number of packet copies, and average packet delay.

		      <p>报告主题：Interesting & Challenge topics in speech area: A personal perspective</p>
		      <p>报告人：张羽（2005级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：Speech signal processing technology that is the most natural form of human communication channel has made remarkable progress over the last 40 years. Although it is very impressive that many speech signal processing systems work very well, there still remain some challenges to be solved. For example, the accuracy of automatic speech recognition systems in adverse conditions needs to be improved to have comparable performance to human beings, and the synthesized speech of text-to-speech (TTS) systems should be more natural. Starting from a research breakthrough in the use of deep neural networks for large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition and a good starting point in commercial usable automatic speech recognition system---iPhone siri, this talk will introduce several interesting and challenge topic on speech signal processing and tell the story behind the development of speech area. It also includes some personal perspective from a potential PhD candidate in speech area. Hopefully, it will inspire more talented undergraduate students in ACM class to take up the challenge of some open research problems in speech signal processing.

		      <p>报告主题：Optimization for Distributed Data-Parallel Computation: From A Programming Language Perspective</p>
		      <p>报告人：刘畅（2005级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：MapReduce style data-parallel computation is increasingly popular because it provides the ability to perform scalable GroupBy-Aggregate operations which are important both for traditional data mining tasks, and also for emerging applications such as web scale machine learning and graph analysis. Most of the data-parallel computation systems provide a hybrid programming model that aims to combine the elegance of declarative relational operators and the flexibility of imperative user-defined functions (UDFs). A data-parallel computation system is traditionally studied either as a distributed system because it involves coordination among a large number of machines, or as a database system because its primary goal is for parallel data processing. However, most of such kind of studies treat a UDF as a "black box", and therefore cannot find out the hidden structural properties which is important for optimization. As a consequence, the extensive use of UDFs becomes an obstacle for the existing techniques. We therefore take a different perspective to turn the UDFs from black boxes into white boxes. This perspective allows us to infer the structural information from the imperical codes to recover those missed optimization opportunities that we have observed in the current practice. Our evaluation over 20,000 real jobs shows a significant reduction on end-to-end latency and on disk and network I/O.

		      <p>报告主题：Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer in Data Mining</p>
		      <p>报告人：杨强（香港科技大学教授）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：In data mining, we often encounter situations where we have an insufficient amount of high-quality data in a target domain, but we may have plenty of auxiliary data in related domains. Transfer learning aims to exploit these additional data to improve the learning performance in the target domain. In this talk, I will give an overview on some recent advances in transfer learning for challenging data mining problems. I will present structural transfer-learning solutions under heterogeneous feature representations. I will also survey cross-domain transfer learning solutions in online recommendation, social media and social network mining. I will discuss some current limitations of cross-domain transfer learning and explore possible future directions.

		      <p>报告主题：Temporal Dynamics Analysis for Recommendation</p>
		      <p>报告人：陈天奇（2006级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：Recommender systems play a very important role to recommend items according to users’ interest and help users tackle the information overload. These systems have been widely used in Internet services such as Amazon, Yahoo! Music, and Last.fm. Temporal information is a very important factor for recommendation. Users' interest change with time, so as the items popularity, how to best taking these information into account to make better recommendation attracts lots of attention recently. In this talk, I will talk about several temporal information modeling algorithms for recommendation in our recent works.

		      <p>报告主题：Collaborative Personalized Tweet Recommendation</p>
		      <p>报告人：陈凯龙（2007级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：Twitter has rapidly grown to a popular social network in recent years and provides a large number of real-time messages for users. Tweets are presented in chronological order and users scan the followees' timelines to find what they are interested in. However, an information overload problem has troubled many users, especially those with many followees and thousands of tweets arriving every day. In this paper, we focus on recommending useful tweets that users are really interested in personally to reduce the users' effort to find useful information. Many kinds of information on Twitter are available for helping recommendation, including the user's own tweet history, retweet history and social relations between users. We propose a method of making tweet recommendations based on collaborative ranking to capture personal interests. It can also conveniently integrate the other useful contextual information. Our final method considers three major elements on Twitter: tweet topic level factors, user social relation factors and explicit features such as authority of the publisher, and quality of the tweet. The experiments show that all the proposed elements are important and our method greatly outperforms several baseline methods.

		      <p>报告主题：On Strategy-proof Allocation without Payments or Priors</p>
		      <p>报告人：张泓洋（2008级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：In this paper we study the problem of allocating divisible items to agents without payments. We assume no prior knowledge about the agents. The utility of an agent is additive. The social welfare of a mechanism is defined as the overall utility of all agents. This model is first studied in [GC20]. Here we are interested in competitive strategy-proof mechanisms, i.e., achieving efficient social welfare.

		      	摘要：Global Lypunov function is an energy-like scaler function. It provides a natural framework to study structure and stability of attractors of dynamical systems. Global Lyapunov function and related applications have attracted researchers' attention since Lyapunov's work. However, there is no systematic way to construct Lyapunov function. Its general existence is even questioned by many researchers. We propose a numerical method to construct the global Lyapunov functions. We apply our method to several famous examples: the Van Der Pol Oscillator, the Brusselator, and the Lorenz system successfully.

		      <p>报告主题：Online Vigilance Analysis Combining Video and Electrooculography Features</p>
		      <p>报告人：杜若飞（2009级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：Vigilance is an indispensable characteristic, especially for drivers, policemen and soldiers. Unfortunately, almost every existing vigilance analysis system has its limitations. In this paper, we proposed a novel system to analyze vigilance combining both video and Electrooculography (EOG) features. Our system exploits 16 kinds of features extracted from an infrared camera and 48 kinds of features from both horizontal and vertical channels of EOG signals. For one thing, the video features include percentage of closure (PERCLOS), eye blinks, slow eye movement (SEM), rapid eye movement (REM), which are also extracted from the EOG signals. For another, features like geometrical features, yawn frequency, body posture are also extracted from the video based on Active Shape Model (ASM). The results of our experiments indicate that our approach outperform that based on either video or EOG alone. In addition, the prediction offered by our model is in close proximity to the actual error rate of the subject. We firmly believe that this system can be further applied to prevent fatigued driving.

		      <p>报告主题：Manhattan Hashing for Large-Scale Image Retrieval</p>
		      <p>报告人：孔维昊（2009级）</p>
		      <p>
		      	摘要：Hashing is used to learn binary-code representation for data with expectation of preserving the neighborhood structure in the original feature space. Due to its fast query speed and reduced storage cost, hashing has been widely used for efficient nearest neighbor search in a large variety of applications like text and image retrieval. Most existing hashing methods adopt Hamming distance to measure the similarity (neighborhood) between points in the hash-code space. However, one problem with Hamming distance is that it may destroy the neighborhood structure in the original feature space, which violates the essential goal of hashing. In this paper, Manhattan hashing (MH), which is based on Manhattan distance, is proposed to solve the problem of Hamming distance based hashing. The basic idea of MH is to encode each projected dimension with multiple bits of natural binary code(NBC), based on which the Manhattan distance between points in the hash code space is calculated for nearest neighbor search. MH can effectively preserve the neighborhood structure in the data to achieve the goal of hashing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt Manhattan distance with NBC for hashing. Experiments on several large-scale image data sets containing up to one million points show that our MH method can significantly outperform other state-of-the-art methods.
